## My process

### Technologies used

- HTML 5
- SCSS

### Things I learnt

1. To create an underline underneath text:

- use `border-bottom`
- set a max-width so that the line won't stretch the whole container
- margin left and right to be auto to place the item in the center
- text-align: center

2. Revised using `repeat(auto-fit, minmax() )` to create a responsive grid layout instead of using media query.

3. Because the navbar is fixed and taken out of the normal document flow, it is necessary to minus the height of navbar from the scoll position so that links in navbar will scroll to correct position.
