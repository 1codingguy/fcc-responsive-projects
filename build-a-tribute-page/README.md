## My process

### Technologies used

- HTML5
- SCSS

### Things I learned

1. `<strong>` tag was used for the year in each bullet point. But since the year carries no "importance" in semantic meaning, a `<span>` tag with a class should be used, the font-boldness can then be adjusted via CSS. ([Click here](https://html.com/tags/strong/) for more on proper use of `strong` element )
2. Learnt about [BEM naming convention](http://getbem.com/naming/). Tried to impliement in this project. But since freeCodeCamp specify names of classes for some containers, couldn't completely follow the convention.
