## My process

### Technologies used

- HTML 5
- SCSS

### Things I learnt

1. Because `position: fixed` has taken navbar out of normal flow, I need to add a `margin-top: 50px` to shift the hero element .downward
2. `<button>` vs `<input type="submit">`

- seems they are interchangable
- to specify the button content in `<input type="submit">`, add a value attribute.

3. To embed a YouTube video:

- Needs to used this link: https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoID
- replace the last videoID part with actual ID
